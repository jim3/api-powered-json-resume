### An API-Powered Resume

A API-Powered Resume using the [gitconnected.com](https://gitconnected.com/portfolio-api) Portfolio API. 

The data is available through the `/v1/portfolio/username` API endpoint which will dynamically update 
your content. The JSON response follows the open source [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

Like most of these projects, I will be updating when I can. The styling is minimal so it can be *easily* customized. This can be used as 
a starting point for your own API-Powered Resume.

No back-end is required. The data is fetched from the API and rendered on the client-side via JavaScript/DOM manipulation.
